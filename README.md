### An Old Symbol Still Stands
When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Oleksandr Nikoryak, director of the Department of Cultural Heritage Protection of the Kyiv City State Administration, worked to protect a symbolic monument of Ukrainian freedom from being destroyed by bombings. However, the Independence Monument, at 40 meters high, was simply too tall, and it would be too expensive to take down, so the monument was removed from protected lists.[^10] Now, as conflict continues between the two nations, the female figure still stands: a maidan named Berehynia -the orante or blessed mother of Ukraine- with <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto= "1361,6,1663,1420"> arms raised, holding the branch of the _guelder rose_ bush. </span> [^11]

Why was the guelder rose (_Viburnum opulus_) plant featured on such a prominent monument? The plant, also called _kalyna_ in Ukrainian and Russian, is an important symbol and loved cultural plant in both nations. For Ukraine, it represents independence and fits right into the location where the <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="50.449486986444576, 30.525408954596692,14">Independence Monument stands: the Maidan Square.</span> This square, in the center of Kyiv, also called “Maidan Nezalezhnosti,” a central space with a long history of civic and political action. It was at this square where students revolted in 1905 and 1917. The Revolution on Granite in 1990, protests in 2000, Orange Revolution in 2004, and Euromaidan in 2013 also took place at this square. The guelder rose, a subtle addition to this landscape, not only stands for continued nationhood in Berehynia’s hands, but is sung about and referenced in other Ukrainian settings today. The little flowering plant has come to represent Ukrainian loyalty, homeland, struggle, struggle, and even protest and it joins the fight for Ukrainian resilience, especially as the country fights to maintain independence from Russia.

In Ukraine, the red berries are embedded into its name. “Chervona kalyna,” the folksong that became an unofficial Ukrainian national anthem, translates to “red viburnum,” which emphasizes the red color of the berries more than the white flower. In fact, the word kalyna is rarely spoken by itself, but instead usually "chervona kalyna.” It is the leaves with the berries, rather than the blossoms, that are the important symbol in Ukrainian culture. _Viburnum opulus_ is called kalyna, or калина обыкновенная, in Russian. In Old Russian, the word for red is “krasni” while the modern word for beautiful is “krasivi.” Generally, things that are red are elevated in status, and many revered landscapes in Russia contain the word “red” in their name: the Red Square, one of the most important sites of Moscow; the red corner full of Orthodox icons, and red easter eggs. Therefore, the red berries of the viburnum are etymologically related to beauty and elevated status.

On the other hand, the English names for the viburnum emphasize its white puffy flowers. Language of Flower books, a popular British literary trend in the 19th Centuy meant to spread awareness about flowers to general audiences, named the viburnum “snowball.” Authors would present the world of botany through dictionaries of flowers and their sentimental meanings, floral poetry, and prose. The guelder rose is represented in many of these works as symbolic of old age, purity, or even the white bosom of Venus.
<param ve-iframe src="https://archive.org/details/floralemblems00philrich/page/325/mode/2up?view=theater">

While only occasionally, the viburnum did enter the context of global botanical trade. In 1773 botanical book _Eden: Or A Compleat Body Of Gardening,_ J. Hill M.D. describes the viburnum in the context of raising flowers according to the English, French, and Dutch. Illustrators of English and French botanical books <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto= "802,45,4014,3487"> portrayed the plant through its flowers,</span> usually forgetting to include depictions of its red berries. Overall, botanists and individuals collecting herbarium specimens of the viburnum had the option to highlight the white flowers, red berries, or in some cases, both.

### For Russia, A Symbol of Beauty and Doom
In Russian folk tradition, the red color of fire and of the kalyna’s berries become a symbol of beauty, and together with the sweetness of raspberries (called malina), they serve as a symbol of love. Later, the viburnum and raspberries represented a beautiful maiden, someone who represents passionate love. One folk song, titled “Kalinka,” a diminutive of of kalyna, the lyrics start: “Kalinka, kalinka, kalinka, my sweet/beauty berry in the garden malinka/my sweet, eh.” Russian folk culture even has a phrase, [kalina krasnaya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalina_krasnaya), common in folksongs and contemporary songs, which represents love, passion, beauty, and even sadness and grief. 
<param ve-iframe src="https://archive.org/details/russianfolksongs0000prok/page/148/mode/2up?q=kalina&view=theater">

The 1974 iconic movie [The Red Snowball Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Red_Snowball_Tree), or Калина красная (Kalina Krasnaya), also has subtle hints toward the plant. In this highest-grossing Soviet film of all time, the protagonist named Yegor Prokudin has just been released from prison and must make a new life for himself in the countryside where viburnum bushes also grow. However, the color of the red viburnum berries hint at a bloody or wounded future for Yegor, and the bitterness of the berries symbolize the tragedy of love and sudden death. In all, because the hero does get shot and both he and his lover die at the end of the film, the viburnum references that the hero of this film was always doomed.

Even in _The Brothers Karamazov_, one of Russia’s most famous novels by Fyodor Dostoevsky, in one climactic scene where brother Dmitri sneaks up to a window with the intent to kill his father, the viburnum berries on a bush outside of the window stop him from doing so. “‘Snowball berries, how red they are!’ he whispered, not knowing why,” writes Dostoevsky from Dmitri’s perspective. Later, in a trial, Dmitri claims that he did not kill his father because his mother was looking down on him and watching him in that moment, perhaps referring to the berries and Mother Russia.

### For Ukraine, Folk Art and Love Language
In Ukraine, it would be difficult to find a village house where there is not at least one kalyna in the garden or even right at the gate, welcoming guests, says writer and researcher of Ukrainian folk art Orysia Paszczak Tracz. In ancient traditional Ukrainian culture, similarly to Russian culture, preference was given to images with red color, from towels and shirts to skirts and shoes, and kalyna berries as well. Petrykivka, a type of traditional Ukrainian painting, often features the berry. Named after a village in Ukraine, a painter will decorate their living quarters with this style of ornamental painting involving roosters and other birds, and local flowers, including the viburnum berries. Families will pass down the tradition, and local schools will teach fundamentals. The painting style was added to the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity (UNESCO) in 2013, and the Vice Prime Minister of Ukraine at the time, Olexandr Vilkul, stated, “Petrykivka is a national brand of Ukraine.”

In 2022, back in Independence square under the maidan holding the golden guelder rose branch, a woman named Varvara Logvyn was found painting red berries in the Petrykivka style along the steel antitank obstacles lining the square. She was inspired to paint the kalyna plant because of a famous pro-Ukraine patriotic song, “Oh, the Red Viburnum in the Meadow." She says of her work, “my way to talk with the world about Ukraine, about our war, about our values. We have to defend our culture. Culture is the basis of a nation, and [Petrykivka painting] shows that Ukraine is very bright.” She sure remained faithful to the folk art techniques, painting with brushes made from cat and squirrel hair and making sure to paint certain strokes in the same direction even while crouched between steel fortifications.

Ukrainian folksongs and folktales speak of the kalyna bush in ways that promote nostalgia for homeland. Many song genres, including ballads, lyrical, spring, harvest, wedding, soldiers’ and shooting songs, speak of the viburnum. They can be humorous and satirical as well, and numerous folksongs compare a chervona kalyna to a beautiful maiden. One Ukrainian harvest song begins, “Oh! nightingale, come down, / Come down from the guelder-rose / Come back, Oh ! my beloved, From Ukraine Home.”

“I am a woman. I am a blade of grass. I am dew. / Without love I am like a guelder rose in the frost,” wrote on Ukrainian poet about the viburnum. Another said “My songs are a guelder rose bridge over the river of time, / I am a pagan in love with life." One can assume that the viburnum takes many symbolic forms, even in more contemporary poetry. Writers across the fields have listed many symbols, from fire and sunlight, to a girl’s virginity, to love, family, blood, and sadness, to the viburnum. The viburnum is a reminder of the motherland and of familiar places left behind. 


### Guelder Rose and the War in Ukraine
On February 27, 2022, an Instagram video of Ukrainian rock singer Andriy Khlyvniuk in military fatigues singing a capella went viral and the Guelder Rose became fundamental to Ukrainian identity once again. The video went viral only a few days after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. The song was “Oi u luzi chervona kalyna” (“Oh, the Red Viburnum in the Meadow),  originally a folk song from the seventeenth century that became associated with the Legion of Ukrainian Sich Riflemen Ukrainian riflemen, a unit within the Austro-Hungarian army during World War I. It continued to be a song of national pride for Ukrainians under the Soviet Union, which prohibited the song since it was deemed too nationalistic and tied to struggles for Ukrainian independence.[^1] In the song, the Guelder Rose functions as a symbol for all of Ukraine. The first lyric of the song reads: “Oh, in the meadow a red kalyna has bent down low, / For some reason, our glorious Ukraine is in sorrow.” In a later verse, the song continues: “Marching forward, our fellow volunteers, into a bloody fray, / For to free our brother Ukrainians from the Moscovite shackles.”

The Russian invasion of Ukraine sparked a worldwide condemnation of Russian aggression and support for Ukrainian independence. In the ensuing months, military aid to Ukraine from NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) allied member countries has allowed Ukraine to defend its independence when initial reports were skeptical of Ukraine’s ability to stave off Russia’s invasion. In many respects, the 2022 invasion was more an escalation of prior Russian aggression rather than a completely new act of war. In 2014, Russia invaded and annexed Crimea, a region of Eastern Ukraine that many now see as a prelude to the current fighting. With constant fighting in the region, the toll of the war and the geopolitical stakes are ever increasing. <param ve-iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-refugees-per-100000?tab=chart&country=OWID_WRL~Europe+%28UN%29~UKR">

Yevgeny Prigozhin’s march toward Moscow, which reporters have variously called a mutiny, rebellion, or coup on Vladimir Putin’s regime, was a surprising twist that has many wondering what it means for Russian support of Putin and for the war in Ukraine.[^2] In early July 2023, the United States sent <span eid="Q184158">cluster munitions</span> to the Ukrainian forces.[^3] This decision has been met with push back by other NATO allies and the international community at large since cluster munitions can be highly inaccurate and have the potential to injure civilians. These recent events show just how volatile and dynamic the war in Ukraine is.

Russia and Ukraine have had a contentious past long before this latest conflict. Untangling this history is especially important both to understand the significance of the guelder rose in the region and its importance in the context of the Russian-Ukraine War because of Vladimir Putin’s frequent invocation of history. Putin argues that since the beginning Russia and Ukraine were one nation, and, therefore, a separate Ukrainian identity and independence poses a threat to Russia. Under the Russian Empire, Ukraine was called “Little Russia,” originally signifying the geographic distance between Ukrainiain territory and Moscow that later took on greater political and nationalist meanings that was a precursor to Ukrainian nation-building.[^4] Putin interprets Russia’s historical relationship with Ukraine as justifying Russia’s claim to Ukrainian territory and identity, As the scholar William Partlett explains, “To Putin, anyone opposing the invasion of Ukraine either does not understand this fundamental historical truth or is a traitor.”[^5] Putin’s historical arguments have been denounced by governments and historians alike for being ahistorical and for spreading propaganda about Russia’s invasion.

### Plants, Music, and Nationalism and Nationalism
Along with being a prominent symbol in Ukrainian and Russian folklore, literature, and film, the guelder rose has a centuries long history in music. Chervona Kalyna, the Ukrainian military song made famous once again in recent years, has become a rallying cry in support of the Ukrainian army against Russia’s invasion.[^6] Since the Instagram video went viral, music groups from many different backgrounds have furthered the song’s reach. The band of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine  performed the song in a style that juxtaposes beautiful choral voices with the visual imagery of powerful military forces.The song has had international reach, too. The American rock band Pink Floyd covered the song and published a music video in support of the Ukrainian army. Through song, guelder rose has become a unifying force of Ukrainian nationalism and support.
<param ve-video vid="ZkMKYPWWmSY" fit="contain">

“Chervona Kalyna” offers a counterexample to what we think of as nationalist music. As the music historian Phillip Vilas Bohlman explains, there are two types of nationalist music. On the one hand, there is nationalist music “from above” – for example, national anthems, military marches, and other songs created or popularized by state institutions. On the other, there is nationalist music “from below,” meaning folk songs and dances, minority song cultures, and poems.[^7] Chervona Kalyna is a case in the middle of this spectrum. What began as a folk song and was made popular by rank-and-file soldiers and social media users has become the “unofficial national anthem” of the Ukrainian state. Guelder rose, historically a symbol of the people, has now become the symbol of the state as well. As a result of this movement from popular anthem to nationalist ballad, Russia has banned the song once again. Playing the song in Russian territory has resulted in fines and arrests.[^8]

The guelder rose, once a frequent symbol in Ukrainian, Russian, and British traditions now appears to firmly represent Ukrainian culture. Whether through a towering independence monument or a patriotic song to build military support, the bush with white flowers and red berries has become one of the most important plants in Ukraine, and the antithesis of Russian state ideology. Russia has also targeted another important plant for Ukraine and the world—wheat. Wheat is so important to the Ukrainian culture and economy, the gold band on Ukraine’s flag symbolizes an endless field of wheat. Russia’s initial blockade of seaports and halting a deal that would allow for grain shipments to resume is a war waged on the Ukrainian economy and global hunger.[^9] If wheat encapsulates the economics of the war in Ukraine, then the guelder rose encapsulates the fraught cultural and ideological context in which the war is operating. At least in this case, the changing significance of plants reflects the complex state of the war in Ukraine.
