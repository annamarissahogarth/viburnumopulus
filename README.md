### An Old Symbol Still Stands
When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Oleksandr Nikoryak, director of the Department of Cultural Heritage Protection of the Kyiv City State Administration, worked to protect a symbolic monument of Ukrainian freedom from being destroyed by bombings. However, the Independence Monument, at 40 meters high, was simply too tall, and it would be too expensive to take down, so the monument was removed from protected lists.[^1] Now, as conflict continues between the two nations, the female figure still stands: a maidan named Berehynia -the orante or blessed mother of Ukraine- with <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto= "1361,6,1663,1420"> arms raised, holding the branch of the _guelder rose_ bush. </span> [^2]

Why was the guelder rose (_Viburnum opulus_) plant featured on such a prominent monument? The plant, also called _kalyna_ in Ukrainian and Russian, is an important symbol and loved cultural plant in both nations. For Ukraine, it represents independence and fits right into the location where the <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="50.449486986444576, 30.525408954596692,14">Independence Monument stands: the Maidan Square.</span> This square, in the center of Kyiv, also called “Maidan Nezalezhnosti,” a central space with a long history of civic and political action. It was at this square where students revolted in 1905 and 1917. The Revolution on Granite in 1990, protests in 2000, Orange Revolution in 2004, and Euromaidan in 2013 also took place at this square.[^3] The guelder rose, a subtle addition to this landscape, not only stands for continued nationhood in Berehynia’s hands, but is sung about and referenced in other Ukrainian settings today. The little flowering plant has come to represent Ukrainian loyalty, homeland, struggle, struggle, and even protest and it joins the fight for Ukrainian resilience, especially as the country fights to maintain independence from Russia.

### Prehistoric Roots 

The guelder-rose has a long-standing relationship with human settlements and culture. This begins all the way from the prehistoric period: <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="55.394211, 9.810635,9">Tybrind Vig</span>, a late Mesolithic coastal settlement of the Ertebølle culture located in present-day Denmark, dated to about 5600-4000 BC, was found to have charred remains of guelder rose seeds[^4]. Since the berries have to be cooked prior to eating, this shows that the guelder rose berries were cooked and consumed at the site. Clusters of guelder rose seeds were also found lying at  <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="53.66606747099045, -7.420011008004994,9">Clonava-1</span>[^5], an island site at Lake Derravagh, present-day Co. Westmeath, Ireland, which is a remnant of the mesolithic Larnian culture.  Since these seeds were found to be uncharred, it is possible this shows their collection prior to being prepared for consumption[^6]. <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="51.285347, 4.251812,9">Doel Sector M</span>, a Swifterbant site dated to the late mesolithic-early neolithic transition period (ca. 4600—4000 B.C.), located in present-day Northwest Belgium, shows remains of guelder-rose berries and seeds as well[^7]. Another site, dating to the later Bronze Age, is at <span data-mouseover-map-flyto="53.20698674768145, -8.551325620026535,9">Greeneenagh</span> in Ireland.

Greeneenagh shows evidence that  Guelder Rose found use beyond just consumption in later periods of prehistory. Greeneenagh was a fulacht fiadt, a site that resembles a burning mound, used for food preparation. The <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="456,296,239,189"> silty-clay trough </span> at the site was used for heating water by fire-reddened stones which in turn were warmed by burning wood. This wood was identified as being from the Guelder Rose Tree, dating to a time range of 791-419 BC[^8].

As the prehistoric data shows, the Guelder Rose is native to the paleoarctic, and it has been used for varied purposes for millennia in regions of Europe. Throughout history, the guelder rose has been introduced to wider ranges of geography. As it moves across boundaries of culture, time, and space, the Guelder Rose takes on new significations and meanings—some of which seem entirely contradictory, but each is still tied intrinsically to the plant’s morphology.

### Resisting Classification: Taxonomy & Nomenclature 

The Guelder Rose seems to elude precise classification. Taxonomically, it belongs to the _Viburnum_ Genus, a clade of flowering plants that consists of shrubs and small trees. The Guelder-Rose was initially placed in the _Caprifoliaceae_ family, commonly known as the Honeysuckle family, which is popularly known for its species that have the status of being invasive in their introduced habitats. The Guelder-Rose was reclassified by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group to being part of the _Adoxaceae_ family. However, this group is often also termed as the _Viburnaceae_[^9]. The issue of classification is not entirely settled[^10].

This seeming confusion spills into the plant’s nomenclature as well: the term Guelder Rose itself is a misnomer, since the plant is not a rose. Simultaneously, the word Guelder gestures to the Gelderland region of the Netherlands, but the plant has no significant relationship of origin or importance to the region. The plant is also called the European guelder, water elder, rose elder, Rose Ebru, cherry-wood, crampbark, and as gilaburu in Turkey. Other names of the plant include Cranberry Bush and Snowball Tree—but both of these confound more than they explain, since the plant is not a Cranberry, and the Snowball is only a single cultivar of it. Its scientific name, _Viburnum Opulus_, has a similar confusion: _Viburnum_ is Latin for the wayfaring tree[^11], and _Opulus_ is Latin for the maple tre [^12]. These other plants are used to signify the Guelder Rose, but its own individuality seems almost slippery. In Ukrainian, Russian, and Polish—the regions where the plant is highly commonplace and holds key symbolic power—it is called Kalyna.

The first recorded use of the term evolutionary biology was in relation to the Guelder-Rose[^13] by the naturalist Grant Allen—in his 1881 text _Vignettes from Nature_, Allen speaks about the “self-same odd, outgrown outer flowers” of the guelder-rose that make it extremely fascinating for the field of evolutionary biology. These outer flowers, Allen writes, look like the petals of another plant “deftly arranged or pinned by some mischievous boy” onto the plant in order “to hoax the unwary botanist with a cunning deception”[^14] The form of the guelder-rose is compared to a mystery, as if a trick is being played on the botanist attempting to study it.

### Morphology: Flower & Fruit 

The trick of the guelder-rose lies in its morphology: <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="1348,661,538,425"> the white flowers that it is known for are actually sterile </span> and serve the purpose of attracting pollinators to the <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="970,596,364,288"> smaller fertile flowers that lie at the center </span> of the inflorescence. The difference in size between these flowers—the larger ones are about 1.5-2.5cm in diameter, while the fertile ones are 4-5mm only—could explain why the sterile flowers capture the imagination of the viewer. It is also to be noted that the guelder-rose flower has an “unpleasant, rather sickly smell”[^15], which means that its white flower must ensure that pollinators are visually driven to the fertile inner flowers so they can bloom into red berries and the plant can reproduce.

The Guelder-Rose is often represented through its widely grown cultivator the ‘Roseum’, which gives the plant its name Snowball. This cultivar consists of only the sterile flowers[^16], which means that the inflorescence becomes a striking ball of white petals, but that it cannot reproduce without human intervention. 
<param ve-image url="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/Viburnum_opulus_%27Roseum%27_Kalina_koralowa_odm._p%C5%82onna_2021-06-02_02.jpg" label= "Roseum, sterile cultivar of the Guelder Rose" license="CC BY-SA 4.0">
<param ve-entity eid="Q4886">

Just as the guelder-rose flower has a strange smell, the fruit is known to have a bitter taste due to the presence of saponin glycosides and slightly toxic viburnine[^17]. For human consumption, it is usually either cooked or frozen before eating. The berries bloom ripen in fall, but they remain on the shoots through the winter season, because of some seed dispersers that are integral to the plant’s reproduction are averse to its taste. The bright red berries of the guelder rose that persist through most of the winter is a powerful image, one which could signal how the interplay of the plant’s reproductive clock and the seasonal transformation of the landscape̦ to produce cultural signification—the red berries must stand out as distinct symbols against the white snow of winter, particularly in regions with colder winters such as Ukraine and Russia.

The aversion of frugivore birds to the bitter guelder-rose berry, however, has its limits. As other fruit sources deplete through the winter, some birds such as the bullfinches act as seed predators—they discard the pulp and fruitskin and proceed to chew the fruit stone, split it in the middle, and then ingest the seed, which means the seed is destroye [^18].

The primary seed dispersal agents of the Guelder Rose are the Cedar Waxwing in North America and the Bohemian Waxwing in the Paleoarctic, its natal range. Unlike seed predators like the bullfinch, the waxwing swallows the fruit as a whole, which means that the seed is left intact after consumption. The plant and the bird  have a unique "mutualistic relationship"[^19]. The waxwing has an unpredictable migration pattern–it does not arrive at the same locations each year. In those years when the waxwing does not disperse the seed, most of them are lost to seed destroyers. As a response, the guelder rose takes on a “costly bet-hedging seed-dispersal strategy” [^20]. In the face of the threat of seed destruction, the Guelder Rose produces as many fruits as it can. In the years when the waxwing does not migrate to the plant’s range, most of these seeds are lost. However, in the years that the waxwing comes, the plant’s bet is successful—the possibility of massive new growth is made possible by the hope of the bird’s arrival at the end of winter.

### Which is more prized? The berries or the flower? 

The unique morphology of the Guelder Rose—with its white flowers that turn into bright red fruits—takes on different associations and meanings across cultures. In Britain, where it is known primarily as the Snowball—after the cultivar Roseum—it is prized for its color primarily. The painting _Guelder Roses and the Venus of Milo_ by French artist Édouard Vuillard juxtaposes the white flower with the backward bust of the classical Venus de Milo, both of which are painted with the same hues of white and gold. This is association with colour is the opposite in the case of Ukraine and Russia, where the red fruit that blossoms in the winter is the plant’s primary cultural symbol, taking on life in household objects as well as art. On the other hand, in Japan, art that represents the Guelder Rose emphasizes the symmetry of its shoots and leaves, rather than placing any emphasis on its flowers or berries. As each culture interpets the Guelder Rose, it brings its own lens, placing value on different parts of the plant. Each culture's take on the guelder rose, however, is defined by the plant's own morphology: each in each iteration, the plant comes alive in different ways.

In Ukraine, the red berries are embedded into its name. “Chervona kalyna,” the folksong that became an unofficial Ukrainian national anthem, translates to “red viburnum,” which emphasizes the red color of the berries more than the white flower. In fact, the word kalyna is rarely spoken by itself, but instead usually "chervona kalyna.” It is the leaves with the berries, rather than the blossoms, that are the important symbol in Ukrainian culture.[^21] _Viburnum opulus_ is called kalyna, or калина обыкновенная, in Russian. In Old Russian, the word for red is “krasni” while the modern word for beautiful is “krasivi.” Generally, things that are red are elevated in status, and many revered landscapes in Russia contain the word “red” in their name: the Red Square, one of the most important sites of Moscow; the red corner full of Orthodox icons, and red easter eggs.[^22] Therefore, the red berries of the viburnum are etymologically related to beauty and elevated status.

On the other hand, the English names for the viburnum emphasize its white puffy flowers. Language of Flower books, a popular British literary trend in the 19th Century meant to spread awareness about flowers to general audiences, named the viburnum “snowball.” Authors would present the world of botany through dictionaries of flowers and their sentimental meanings, floral poetry, and prose. The guelder rose is represented in many of these works as symbolic of old age, purity, or even the white bosom of Venus.[^23]
<param ve-iframe src="https://archive.org/details/floralemblems00philrich/page/325/mode/2up?view=theater">

While only occasionally, the viburnum did enter the context of global botanical trade. In 1773 botanical book _Eden: Or A Compleat Body Of Gardening,_ J. Hill M.D. describes the viburnum in the context of raising flowers according to the English, French, and Dutch.[^24] Illustrators of English and French botanical books <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto= "802,45,4014,3487"> portrayed the plant through its flowers,</span> usually forgetting to include depictions of its red berries. Overall, botanists and individuals collecting herbarium specimens of the viburnum had the option to highlight the white flowers, red berries, or in some cases, both.

### For Russia, A Symbol of Beauty and Doom
In Russian folk tradition, the red color of fire and of the kalyna’s berries become a symbol of beauty, and together with the sweetness of raspberries (called malina), they serve as a symbol of love. Later, the viburnum and raspberries represented a beautiful maiden, someone who represents passionate love. One folk song, titled “Kalinka,” a diminutive of of kalyna, the lyrics start: “Kalinka, kalinka, kalinka, my sweet/beauty berry in the garden malinka/my sweet, eh.”[^25] Russian folk culture even has a phrase, [kalina krasnaya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalina_krasnaya), common in folksongs and contemporary songs, which represents love, passion, beauty, and even sadness and grief.[^26] 
<param ve-iframe src="https://archive.org/details/russianfolksongs0000prok/page/148/mode/2up?q=kalina&view=theater">

The 1974 iconic movie [The Red Snowball Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Red_Snowball_Tree), or Калина красная (Kalina Krasnaya), also has subtle hints toward the plant. In this highest-grossing Soviet film of all time, the protagonist named Yegor Prokudin has just been released from prison and must make a new life for himself in the countryside where viburnum bushes also grow. However, the color of the red viburnum berries hint at a bloody or wounded future for Yegor, and the bitterness of the berries symbolize the tragedy of love and sudden death. In all, because the hero does get shot and both he and his lover die at the end of the film, the viburnum references that the hero of this film was always doomed.[^27]
<param ve-video vid="a-RLbCXVvwI">

Even in _The Brothers Karamazov_, one of Russia’s most famous novels by Fyodor Dostoevsky, in one climactic scene where brother Dmitri sneaks up to a window with the intent to kill his father, the viburnum berries on a bush outside of the window stop him from doing so. “‘Snowball berries, how red they are!’ he whispered, not knowing why,” writes Dostoevsky from Dmitri’s perspective. Later, in a trial, Dmitri claims that he did not kill his father because his mother was looking down on him and watching him in that moment, perhaps referring to the berries and Mother Russia.[^28]

### For Ukraine, Folk Art and Love Language
In Ukraine, it would be difficult to find a village house where there is not at least one kalyna in the garden or even right at the gate, welcoming guests, says writer and researcher of Ukrainian folk art Orysia Paszczak Tracz. In ancient traditional Ukrainian culture, similarly to Russian culture, preference was given to images with red color, from towels and shirts to skirts and shoes, and kalyna berries as well.[^29] Petrykivka, a type of traditional Ukrainian painting, often features the berry. Named after a village in Ukraine, a painter will decorate their living quarters with this style of ornamental painting involving roosters and other birds, and local flowers, including the viburnum berries. Families will pass down the tradition, and local schools will teach fundamentals.[^30] The painting style was added to the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity (UNESCO) in 2013, and the Vice Prime Minister of Ukraine at the time, Olexandr Vilkul, stated, “Petrykivka is a national brand of Ukraine.”[^31]

In 2022, back in Independence square under the maidan holding the golden guelder rose branch, a woman named Varvara Logvyn was found painting red berries in the Petrykivka style along the steel antitank obstacles lining the square. She was inspired to paint the kalyna plant because of a famous pro-Ukraine patriotic song, “Oh, the Red Viburnum in the Meadow." She says of her work, “my way to talk with the world about Ukraine, about our war, about our values. We have to defend our culture. Culture is the basis of a nation, and [Petrykivka painting] shows that Ukraine is very bright.” She sure remained faithful to the folk art techniques, painting with brushes made from cat and squirrel hair and making sure to paint certain strokes in the same direction even while crouched between steel fortifications.[^32]

Towels (Рушники) are an important object in Ukrainian folk art of the latter 19th century and can be presented at births, weddings, to guests, and more. They are also a common decorative feature of Ukrainian homes, both rural and urban. One towel of the collection at the Dnipro National Historical Museum features a viburnum. It was a girl’s towel, embroidered in 1908 by Nadiya Kovalenko, from the Petrykivka village. This towel is embroidered with a floral ornament made of viburnums, cornflowers, and ears of corn, and the nightingale on the viburnum branch symbolizes the continuation of the family. [^33]

Naïve art, a type of fine art created by someone who lacks the formal education and training that a professional artist under metropolitan standards would likely go through, though they may have received local training and/or are self trained. Of the Ukrainian naïve artists of the 20th Century, the kalyna does make an appearance. Kateryna Bilokur’s 1958 “Flowers and Viburnum”  painting shows the leaves of a viburnum tree and the white balls of flowers. One of Ukraine’s most loved artists, Maria Primachenko’s “Red Snowball Tree Blooms Over a Well” (1982) shows the red and white flowers bursting from a tree amongst a male and female figure. Growing up, Primachenko’s mother taught her how to embroider and decorate easter eggs, and she used inspiration from her dreams and tradition in her paintings. Four years before “Red Snowball Tree Blooms Over a Well,” Primachenko had painted “Our Army Our Protectors,” where she depicted Ukrainian soldiers in traditional attire, standing below tall flowers. More recently, she created works depicting peace between Ukraine and Russia as well as the bravery of Ukrainian people. [^34]

Ukrainian folksongs and folktales speak of the kalyna bush in ways that promote nostalgia for homeland. Many song genres, including ballads, lyrical, spring, harvest, wedding, soldiers’ and shooting songs, speak of the viburnum. They can be humorous and satirical as well, and numerous folksongs compare a chervona kalyna to a beautiful maiden.[^35] One Ukrainian harvest song begins, “Oh! nightingale, come down, / Come down from the guelder-rose / Come back, Oh ! my beloved, From Ukraine Home.”

“I am a woman. I am a blade of grass. I am dew. / Without love I am like a guelder rose in the frost,”[^36] wrote a Ukrainian poet about the viburnum. Another said “My songs are a guelder rose bridge over the river of time, / I am a pagan in love with life."[^37] One can assume that the viburnum takes many symbolic forms, even in more contemporary poetry. Writers across the fields have listed many symbols, from fire and sunlight, to a girl’s virginity, to love, family, blood, and sadness, to the viburnum.[^38] To many, it is a reminder of the motherland and of familiar places left behind.[^39] 

### Kalynova Sopilka: The Guelder Rose Flute

The _Kalynova Sopika_, The Guelder Rose flute, is a cultural object that holds the fascinating power of bridging oppositions—between two rival siblings, between Ukraine and Russia, between life and death. The Twa Sisters is a traditional murder ballad where one sister kills the other out of jealousy. Different parts of Europe have their own variants of the tale, but they all end with an instrument being made out of the skeleton of the dead sister, who then sings the truth of her death[^40]. In the Ukranian version of the tale, there is no “singing bone” motif as there is in other variants—instead the guelder rose flute takes on the role of the skeleton[^41]. The sister is killed near a guelder rose tree, and a traveling merchant fashions a flute out of the wood of the tree. When he plays the flute, the voice of the deceased sister comes forth from the instrument and narrates her story, which she sings to the villagers and her family. The wood of the guelder rose takes on the mythological power of being able to express grief, separation, and truth.

In the contemporary Ukranian author Oksana Zabuzhko’s short story collection _Your Ad Could Go Here_, the motif of the guelder rose flute is complicated by questions of guilt. Two short stories in the collection are threaded together through the flute. The first story, _Oh Sister, My Sister_, is a second-person narration of a girl who blames herself for the abortive death of her sister. The story is set in Ukrainian Soviet Russia, and the shadow of the KGB hangs over the family, especially since the father, Anton, is an escapee from a Gulag camp. The trauma of the KGB interrogating the household is tied up with the mother’s, Natalia’s, abortion. As the KGB officer rummages through the house, he pulls a book from the girl’s hand, a fairytale collection that contains the story of the guelder rose flute. Zabuzhko’s narration turns a sister killing sister upside down—“You don’t have to plunge a knife into someone’s heart to end them—simply having already been born is enough”[^42]. The sister who was never born haunts the mother and daughter through the story, and it is only when Anton dies and reunites with this unborn sister that the mother-daughter find peace. In the latter half of the collection, Zabuzhko writes her own short story adaptation of _The Tale of The Guelder Rose Flute_. In this version, the older sister is driven to join hands with the devil and murder her younger sister when she decides to marry her abuser. In this re-telling, guilt becomes a more complicated phenomenon: when the younger sister sings the truth of her death through the guelder rose flute, her own betrayal of her sister is already known. The catharsis of the revelation of murder is accompanied by the dubiousness of culpability and blame.

The guelder rose flute is a key symbol in Oleksandr Ilchenko’s  _A Cossack Never Dies, or Mamai and the Other Woman_. Written during the Soviet Era, on the surface, the novel appears to be a “run of the mill curtsy to the Russian ‘elder brother’" [^43] which is a a recurring sibling motif in Ukrainian & Russian relations. However, the novel offers a subversive reading of politics, history, and nationhood. The guelder rose flute appears in the novel as the object the protagonist Omelian, the eponymous Cossack, carries to Moscow as a magical object that links him to his home, Ukraine. This flute is later broken by Arina, a Russian character, to protect Omelian as he refuses to stop playing the flute despite the tsar’s ban on secular music. At the end of the novel, however, Omelian offers one half of the broken guelder rose flute to the Tsar—suggesting the potential of repair despite the damaged relationship. This is highlighted by the epigraph of the Moscow chapter of the novel: “Russia and Ukraine are a Guelder Rose that grows from the same root”[^44]. Though the flute is half-broken, there is the potential for friendship in the future—as long as Russia and Ukraine meet as equals, not as two siblings, one older, one younger, that repeat a bloody history of conflict, subjugation, and suffering.

### Guelder Rose and the War in Ukraine
On February 27, 2022, an Instagram video of Ukrainian rock singer Andriy Khlyvniuk in military fatigues singing a capella went viral and the Guelder Rose became fundamental to Ukrainian identity once again. The video went viral only a few days after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. The song was “Oi u luzi chervona kalyna” (“Oh, the Red Viburnum in the Meadow),  originally a folk song from the seventeenth century that became associated with the Legion of Ukrainian Sich Riflemen Ukrainian riflemen, a unit within the Austro-Hungarian army during World War I. It continued to be a song of national pride for Ukrainians under the Soviet Union, which prohibited the song since it was deemed too nationalistic and tied to struggles for Ukrainian independence.[^45] In the song, the Guelder Rose functions as a symbol for all of Ukraine. The first lyric of the song reads: “Oh, in the meadow a red kalyna has bent down low, / For some reason, our glorious Ukraine is in sorrow.” In a later verse, the song continues: “Marching forward, our fellow volunteers, into a bloody fray, / For to free our brother Ukrainians from the Moscovite shackles.”

The Russian invasion of Ukraine sparked a worldwide condemnation of Russian aggression and support for Ukrainian independence. In the ensuing months, military aid to Ukraine from NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) allied member countries has allowed Ukraine to defend its independence when initial reports were skeptical of Ukraine’s ability to stave off Russia’s invasion. In many respects, the 2022 invasion was more an escalation of prior Russian aggression rather than a completely new act of war. In 2014, Russia invaded and annexed Crimea, a region of Eastern Ukraine that many now see as a prelude to the current fighting. With constant fighting in the region, the toll of the war and the geopolitical stakes are ever increasing. <param ve-iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-refugees-per-100000?tab=chart&country=OWID_WRL~Europe+%28UN%29~UKR">

Yevgeny Prigozhin’s march toward Moscow, which reporters have variously called a mutiny, rebellion, or coup on Vladimir Putin’s regime, was a surprising twist that has many wondering what it means for Russian support of Putin and for the war in Ukraine.[^46] In early July 2023, the United States sent <span eid="Q184158">cluster munitions</span> to the Ukrainian forces.[^47] This decision has been met with push back by other NATO allies and the international community at large since cluster munitions can be highly inaccurate and have the potential to injure civilians. These recent events show just how volatile and dynamic the war in Ukraine is.

Russia and Ukraine have had a contentious past long before this latest conflict. Untangling this history is especially important both to understand the significance of the guelder rose in the region and its importance in the context of the Russian-Ukraine War because of Vladimir Putin’s frequent invocation of history. Putin argues that since the beginning Russia and Ukraine were one nation, and, therefore, a separate Ukrainian identity and independence poses a threat to Russia. Under the Russian Empire, Ukraine was called “Little Russia,” originally signifying the geographic distance between Ukrainiain territory and Moscow that later took on greater political and nationalist meanings that was a precursor to Ukrainian nation-building.[^48] Putin interprets Russia’s historical relationship with Ukraine as justifying Russia’s claim to Ukrainian territory and identity, As the scholar William Partlett explains, “To Putin, anyone opposing the invasion of Ukraine either does not understand this fundamental historical truth or is a traitor.”[^49] Putin’s historical arguments have been denounced by governments and historians alike for being ahistorical and for spreading propaganda about Russia’s invasion.

### Plants, Music, and Nationalism
Along with being a prominent symbol in Ukrainian and Russian folklore, literature, and film, the guelder rose has a centuries long history in music. Chervona Kalyna, the Ukrainian military song made famous once again in recent years, has become a rallying cry in support of the Ukrainian army against Russia’s invasion.[^50] Since the Instagram video went viral, music groups from many different backgrounds have furthered the song’s reach. The band of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine  performed the song in a style that juxtaposes beautiful choral voices with the visual imagery of powerful military forces.The song has had international reach, too. The American rock band Pink Floyd covered the song and published a music video in support of the Ukrainian army. Through song, guelder rose has become a unifying force of Ukrainian nationalism and support.
<param ve-video vid="ZkMKYPWWmSY" fit="contain">

“Chervona Kalyna” offers a counterexample to what we think of as nationalist music. As the music historian Phillip Vilas Bohlman explains, there are two types of nationalist music. On the one hand, there is nationalist music “from above” – for example, national anthems, military marches, and other songs created or popularized by state institutions. On the other, there is nationalist music “from below,” meaning folk songs and dances, minority song cultures, and poems.[^51] Chervona Kalyna is a case in the middle of this spectrum. What began as a folk song and was made popular by rank-and-file soldiers and social media users has become the “unofficial national anthem” of the Ukrainian state. Guelder rose, historically a symbol of the people, has now become the symbol of the state as well. As a result of this movement from popular anthem to nationalist ballad, Russia has banned the song once again. Playing the song in Russian territory has resulted in fines and arrests.[^52]

The guelder rose, once a frequent symbol in Ukrainian, Russian, and British traditions now appears to firmly represent Ukrainian culture. Whether through a towering independence monument or a patriotic song to build military support, the bush with white flowers and red berries has become one of the most important plants in Ukraine, and the antithesis of Russian state ideology. Russia has also targeted another important plant for Ukraine and the world—wheat. Wheat is so important to the Ukrainian culture and economy, the gold band on Ukraine’s flag symbolizes an endless field of wheat. Russia’s initial blockade of seaports and halting a deal that would allow for grain shipments to resume is a war waged on the Ukrainian economy and global hunger.[^53] If wheat encapsulates the economics of the war in Ukraine, then the guelder rose encapsulates the fraught cultural and ideological context in which the war is operating. At least in this case, the changing significance of plants reflects the complex state of the war in Ukraine.
